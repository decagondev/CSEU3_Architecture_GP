# let's make a simple data driven machine!!!


# think of some operations that we might want to perform such as print something, load  or store something etc
# maybe some way to stop execution and some arithmetic operations

# lets make a model of memory to hold our program

# think about keeping track where we are currently in mem to fetch the next instruction

# are we actually running

# lets make a running loop...
    # extract a command maybe?

    # lets check what command has been fetched

    # how will we move forward in memory to grab the next command?
